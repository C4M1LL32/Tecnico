Running a server can be a little challenging for those who do not understand networking.
In a nutshell, you need to:
1. Create a folder on desktop on the computer you want for the server
2. Install the server program available from Mojang's website
3. Set up port forwarding on your router
4. Acquire your server's IP address (via ipchicken.com) and give it to your friend(s) to join

That's as much detail as I want to try to explain with servers. I don't recommend you creating
a server if don't understand anything about routers. If this is the case, try to find a friend
who will host the map.
