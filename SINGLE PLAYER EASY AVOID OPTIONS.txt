This map was built in 1.6 and updated to 1.7.4.
I have no plans on updating the map any further.
There is a bug in 1.7.X when simply viewing the Difficulty on the Options Screen,
that will overwrite the command blocks difficulty setting.
I can not do anything about this.



THIS BUG ONLY OCCURS ON SINGLE PLAYER




If you find yourself getting hungry when you shouldn't or no mobs are spawning when they should,
you may have accidentally changed the difficulty of the map.

If you notice something off like this, you may have to change difficulty manually.
You should not be getting hungry in Parkour and Puzzle, so if you are, switch to peaceful mode.
