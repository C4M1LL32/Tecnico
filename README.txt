~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thank you for downloading Diversity!  This map is an older creation little old but
has been updated numerous time to fix bigs. This current version is 1.3.4, and I do
not check this map frequently. If you experience any bugs, please contact me via the
Minecraft Forums on the map thread for Diversity or on Twitter - @theqmagnet

BUKKIT:
This map is NOT compatible with Bukkit.  My apologies.


SERVER:
For Multiplayer, you MUST have command blocks enabled.
I recommend you keep the game to 2 players, but 3 could work.
Your server.properties file should include the following items

          allow-nether=true
          allow-flight=false
          max-build-height=256
          spawn-npcs=true
          spawn-animals=true
          pvp=false
          difficulty=0
          enable-command-block=true
          gamemode=2
          spawn-monsters=true





Good luck and thank you very much for showing interest in the map!
