Thank you for downloading Diversity 2! I know it's a bit of reading, but make sure you understand there are some settings
you NEED to have on in order for the map to work properly, especially the items listed under SERVER for multiplayer.
Good luck! If you choose to record this map for your Let's Play, let us know! But please include the map link in your description.

MINECRAFT VERSION:
This version must be played in 1.8.8


SERVER:
For Multiplayer, you MUST have command blocks enabled. There are a few other important items you need to allow for this
map to work, notably allow flight due to a weird unwanted server kick.
In your server.properties file, make sure you have these:

        enable-command-block=true
        allow-nether=true
        allow-flight=true
        max-build-height=256
        spawn-npcs=true
        spawn-animals=true
        spawn-monsters=true


We recommend you keep the game to 1-2 players, but 3 could work.
This map is NOT compatible with Bukkit.  Our apologies.


THE RULE:
** Don't type commands **
Diversity 2 is a very complex map that works only if the map is unaltered from the command blocks placed.
Do not change your gamemode, unless absolutely necessary.


REQUIREMENTS:
- Minecraft 1.8.8
- Render Distance: Minimum 9 Chunks
- Vanilla Server for Multiplayer (no Bukkit)


RECOMMENDATIONS:
- 64-bit Java
- Default Texture/Resource Pack
- Brightness: Full/Bright
- Particles: All
- Clouds: Off
- 1-3 players
- Render Distance: 10-16 Chunks
- 4GB or higher allocated to Minecraft


BUGS:
Please report bugs, glitches, broken redstone or command items, missing or misplaced blocks, spelling mistakes, or anything odd at the minecraft forums post for the map.
We've designed the map so that everything in Diversity 2 will change its settings on its own. You do not have to worry about
starting in game modes or difficulty.




Good luck and thank you very much for showing interest in the map!
